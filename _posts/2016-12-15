Generative modelling is in some ways reminiscent of the atom-to-matter paradigm of modern chemical thought.  The elemental forms combine and interact in the strangest of ways resulting in a complex structure which has its own set of observable statistical or global properties. Does our understanding of atom, help us understand matter and its properties better? Or can find the source of these global properties in some fundamental properties of the elemental forms? We could even go a step further. Can we simulate these complex structures if we find the right set of knobs to manipulate atomic forms?
