## Where does the story begin?

Generative modelling is one of the most fascinating paradigms of AI. And the story of generative modelling begins at observations of a phenomenon. Colloquially, we often associate the word phenomenon for an object of discussion, when we believe that the object came into being, that it exists because it got created, or somehow generated. Often, in order to understand such a phenomemnon, we attempt to recreate or mimic its underlying generative process. One such phenomemon that AI has been successfull at is speech. AI claims to understand its observation (spoken dialouges) through a surgical breakdown of how elemental forms like sound waves, phonemes, words and sentences are strung together its synthesis.

### CLassical modelling for clueless beginings

To a foreign eye, an observed phenomenon in its crudest form is a spreadsheet full of numbers. Let's call this collection of observations as $$X = \{x_i\}_{i \in I}$$.

Furthermore, if the only other piece of information provided is that these numbers were somehow generated, then graphical models offer a generic framework to begin an investigation.

For the sake of illustration, let us take a handcrafted csv file. This file consists of list of 13-dimensional vectors that were ‘somehow’ generated.

### The a b c of simulation models

Complex phenomenon like weather, brain, genetics or the Big-Bang have been  of study for centuries. Their mysteriousness rarely fails to strike a chord with human curiosity. With the current knowledge at disposal, a researcher often scripts a simulator that captures the underlying dynamics.
