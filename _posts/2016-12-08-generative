## Where does the story begin?

Generative modelling is one of the most fascinating paradigms of AI. And the story of generative modelling begins at observations of phenomena. Colloquially,
we associate phenomenon with an object of discussion, when we believe that the object somehow came into being, that it exists because it got created, or
somehow generated. Often, in order to understand such a phenomemnon, we attempt to recreate or mimic its underlying generative process. One such phenomemon 
that AI has been successfull at mimicing is natural speech. AI claims to 'understand' spoken speech through a surgical breakdown of 
how elemental forms like sound waves, phonemes, words and sentences are strung together in its synthesis.

### A classical generator

Often a statistsian's kneejerk reaction to a sequence of real numbers is computing sample statistics like mean and variance. Although mathemtically grounded in law of large numbers, implicit to this computation is the notion of existence. A black-box exists that spits out numbers.  Our proposal to mimicing its creative process is via a sampler.  
 
The existence of a Probability distribution function,  

The observations of a phenomenon in their most primitive compuational form are recorded as numbers. Let's call this collection of $$N$$ observations of the
phenomenon as $$X = \{x_i\}_1^N$$.  our generative modelling, we are foruntate to have access to some control knobs, $$\Theta = \{\theta_j\}$$. 
Some of these knobs provide us the necessary randomness for generate diverse samples. This irreducible knob is commonly refferred to as noise. 
By what the generative process is, is also a knob, but this is a reflection of what we hypothesize and believe, and hence, is fixed. 
The third set of knobs are the ones we can manipulate. These knobs allow us to direct our model towards generating something meaningful. 

Graphical models offer a generic framework to begin an investigation, when the only other piece of information provided is that these numbers were somehow generated. For the sake of illustration, let's say that these observations are 13-dimensional real-numbered vectors (available here).


### The a b c of simulation models

Complex phenomenon like weather, brain, genetics or the Big-Bang have been  of study for centuries. Their mysteriousness rarely fails to strike a chord with human curiosity. With the current knowledge at disposal, a researcher often scripts a simulator that captures the underlying dynamics.
